# imgbbUpldr
With this app, you can easy and anonymously upload images to the server imgbb.com, set an auto-delete timer for each and save the links to your photos in a handy list.

Set the photo storage period by clicking on the add image button in the panel and selecting a value from the list. (default is 1 month)

Then select an image from the gallery by clicking the add image button. At the end of uploading the file to the server, you will see a frame with a smaller copy of the image, the upload date, url of image page, and a countdown timer for deleting a file from the server.

There are two buttons on the right: the first one copies the url to the clipboard, the second one deletes this line from the application. (NOT FROM THE SERVER!!!)
